                            From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia <br> <br>


                            <b> Sania Mirza </b> (ˈsaːnijaː ˈmirzaː; born 15 November 1986) is an Indian former
                            professional
                            tennis
                            player. A former doubles world No. 1, she won six major titles – three in women's doubles
                            and
                            three in mixed doubles.[4][5] From 2003 until her retirement from singles in 2013, she was
                            ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as the Indian No. 1 in singles.[6][7] Throughout
                            her
                            career, Mirza has established herself as one of the most known, highest-paid, and
                            influential
                            athletes in India.[8][9][10]

                        
                        In singles, Mirza had wins over Svetlana Kuznetsova, Vera Zvonareva, and Marion Bartoli, as well
                        as former world-number-ones Martina Hingis, Dinara Safina, and Victoria Azarenka. She is the
                        highest-ranked Indian female player ever, peaking at world No. 27 in mid-2007. However, a major
                        wrist injury caused her to shift to doubles. Mirza has achieved a number of firsts for women's
                        tennis in India, including reaching the one million-US$ mark in career earnings (currently over
                        US$7.2 million), winning a singles WTA Tour title, and winning a major title, as well as
                        qualifying for (and eventually winning) the WTA Finals in 2014 in doubles partnering Cara Black,
                        and defending her title the following year partnering Martina Hingis.[11] Mirza retired from
                        professional tennis in February 2023.[12]

                        She is one of only two Indian women to win a WTA Tour title, and the only one to be ranked
                        within the top 100 in singles. Mirza is the third Indian woman in the Open era (after Nirupama
                        Mankad and Nirupama Sanjeev, and the second in singles after Sanjeev) to contest and win a match
                        at a major, and the first to advance past the second round. In doubles, Mirza won 43 WTA titles
                        and spent 91 weeks as world No. 1.[13] In 2005, Mirza was crowned the Newcomer of the Year by
                        the WTA, and in 2015 she and Martina Hingis were the Doubles Team of the Year, going on to earn
                        a 44-match winning streak, one of the longest in history. Mirza has also won a total of 14
                        medals (including six golds) at three major multi-sport events, namely the Asian Games, the
                        Commonwealth Games and the Afro-Asian Games.

                        Mirza was named one of the "50 Heroes of Asia" by Time in October 2005.[14] In March 2010, The
                        Economic Times named Mirza in its list of the "33 women who made India proud".[15] She was
                        appointed as the UN Women's Goodwill Ambassador for South Asia during the International Day To
                        End Violence Against Women on 25 November 2013.[16] She was named in Time magazine's 2016 list
                        of the 100 most influential people in the world.[17]

                        <h2> Early life <sub>edit</sub> </h2>
                        <hr>
                        Sania Mirza was born on 15 November 1986 in Mumbai to Hyderabadi Muslim parents Imran Mirza, a
                        sports journalist,[18] and his wife Naseema, who worked in a printing business. Shortly after
                        her birth, her family moved to Hyderabad where she and younger sister Anam were raised in a
                        religious Sunni Muslim family. Anam is married to cricketer Mohammad Asaduddin, the son of
                        former India national cricket team captain, Mohammad Azharuddin.[19] She is the distant relative
                        of former cricket captains Ghulam Ahmed of India, and Asif Iqbal of Pakistan.[20] She took up
                        tennis at the age of six. She has been coached by her father and also Roger Anderson.

                        She attended Nasr School in Hyderabad. She later graduated from the St. Mary's College,
                        Hyderabad. Mirza also received an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from the Dr. M.G.R.
                        Educational and Research Institute in Chennai on 11 December 2008.[21] Apart from tennis, Mirza
                        is also particularly good at cricket and swimming. <br><br>

                        <h3> 2001–2003: Success on the ITF Junior Circuit <sub>edit</sub> </h3>
                        <br>
                        Sania Mirza began playing tennis at the age of six, turning professional in 2003. She was
                        trained by her father. Mirza won ten singles and thirteen doubles titles as a junior player. She
                        won the 2003 Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles title, partnering Alisa Kleybanova. She also
                        reached the semifinals of the 2003 US Open girls' doubles, with Sanaa Bhambri, and the
                        quarterfinals of the 2002 US Open girls' doubles. On the senior circuit, Mirza started to show
                        early success as she made her debut in April 2001 on the ITF Circuit as a 15-year-old. Her
                        highlights of 2001 include a quarterfinal showing in Pune and a semifinal finish in New Delhi.
                        As the 2002 season began, she turned around a season of early losses to winning three straight
                        titles; her first in her hometown Hyderabad and the other two in Manila, Philippines. Sania
                        Mirza clinched the women's gold medal in tennis in 2002 National Games of India in Hyderabad at
                        the age of 16 years.[22][23][24]

                        In February 2003, Mirza was given a wildcard to play in her first ever WTA tournament, at the
                        Hyderabad Open, in her hometown. She lost the tough first round encounter to Australia's Evie
                        Dominikovic in three sets. The following week, at the Qatar Ladies Open, she fell to Czech Olga
                        Blahotová in the first qualifying round. She had a good result representing India on the Fed
                        Cup, winning three straight matches. She helped India win a bronze medal in the mixed doubles
                        event of the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, partnering Leander Paes. In addition, Mirza picked up
                        four gold medals at the 2003 Afro-Asian Games in Hyderabad. <br><br>

                        <h3> 2004–2005: Success in WTA Tour and Grand Slam tournaments <sub>edit</sub> </h3>
                        <br>
                        At her hometown event, the Hyderabad Open, Mirza was a wildcard entrant. She put up a good fight
                        against the fourth seed and eventual champion, Nicole Pratt, in round one, but lost in three
                        sets. She won her first WTA doubles title at the same event, partnering Liezel Huber. She then
                        received a wildcard to compete at Casablanca, Morocco, but suffered a first-round defeat by
                        eventual champion Émilie Loit.

                        On the ITF Circuit, Mirza ended runner-up at the Palm Beach Gardens Challenger where she fell to
                        Sesil Karatantcheva. Mirza won six ITF singles titles in 2004. Going into the 2005 Australian
                        Open, she defeated Cindy Watson and Petra Mandula in the first and second rounds, respectively,
                        to reach the third round where she was beaten in straight sets by eventual champion Serena
                        Williams. In February, Mirza became the first-ever Indian woman to win a WTA Tour title, by
                        winning her hometown event, the Hyderabad Open, defeating ninth-seeded Alona Bondarenko in the
                        final. At Dubai, she upset in round two 4th seed and reigning US Open champion Svetlana
                        Kuznetsova to reach the biggest quarterfinal of her career. In the second round of the Wimbledon
                        Championships, she lost to Kuznetsova in a tight three-setter.

                        In August, she reached the third round at the Stanford Classic, falling to Morigami. Mirza
                        reached her second WTA final at the Forest Hills Tennis Classic, falling to Lucie Šafářová.
                        Mirza became the first Indian woman to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam tournament at the
                        US Open, defeating Mashona Washington, Maria Elena Camerin and Marion Bartoli, before losing to
                        top seed Maria Sharapova, in the round of 16. At the Japan Women's Open, Mirza reached
                        semifinals with wins over Vilmarie Castellvi, Aiko Nakamura and Vera Zvonareva, before being
                        overpowered by Tatiana Golovin. Thanks to a successful 2005 season, Mirza was named the WTA
                        Newcomer of the Year.
